1. About the PBCore XML Editor
*****************************************

This is a demonstration Orbeon XForms-based editor for PBCore documents. It should be deployed to an existing Java servlet container with Orbeon already installed and functioning. This initial work is based on existing XForms/MODS work done by Brown University <http://dl.lib.brown.edu/its/software/metadata/>.

As mentioned, it is based on the open source forms solution, Orbeon.
Orbeon, allows you to write XForms which are transalated on the
server side to html, CSS and JavaScript.  It is delivered
to standard web browsers (including Internet Explorer, Firefox,
Safari and Opera) thanks to XForms and Ajax technology, with no
need for client-side software or plugins.

The PBCore XML Editor is made up of one main html file along with a schema, stylesheet, and numerous XML files that represent XML instances. Together these files produce a PBCore XML Editor.

This particular implemtation integrates the Orbeon Forms XForms
engine within a Java web application.  It is seperate from the
Orbeon WAR file.  With this method, the MODS Editor application
is deployed in its own Java web archive (WAR), and Orbeon Forms
in its own WAR.

You can load existing XML documents by using the "src" request parameter -- e.g.  http://my.servlet.server/editor/pbcore/demo.html?src={url to an existing document}
